# Commitment and Maintenance Policy for Open-Source Projects

Ever since 2020, I've been actively involved in contributing to and launching open-source projects, driven by a dual purpose: to absorb insights from industry experts and contribute meaningfully to the developer community.

The journey, particularly with my oldest OSS project, dating back four years (accessible at https://github.com/Dahkenangnon/flutter_feathersjs), has taught me the intricacies of maintaining open-source projects.

To ensure a continued focus on learning and contribution, I've established a set of guidelines. These policies serve as a framework to help me decide whether to persist in maintaining a project or consider its closure. Let's delve into these policies:

## Initiating an Open-Source Project

I typically kickstart an OSS under various circumstances, including:
- Learning new skills by addressing common issues faced by developers.
- Replicating existing projects in different ecosystems or languages.
- Solving problems I've personally encountered and believe others may face.
- Identifying opportunities to bring value to the broader community.

This list is not exhaustive and reflects the diverse motivations behind each project.

## Conditions for Project Maintenance

Maintaining an OSS comes with its own challenges. Here are the conditions that guide my decision to continue or archive a project:
- Any project initiated by me that fails to accumulate 1,000 stars within a year will be considered for closure.
- Lack of issue reporting, contributions, or pull requests signals minimal user engagement. In such cases, the project may be archived.
- A decline in interest on distribution platforms (such as npm, pub.dev, packagist.org) could also prompt archival.

## How You Can Support

Your support is instrumental in sustaining my OSS projects, whether they are integral to your business or personal projects. Here's how you can contribute:
- Start by starring the project on its GitHub repository.
- Raise issues to suggest improvements or submit pull requests to propose new features.
- Sponsor me via GitHub Sponsorship.
- Provide feedback on the practical use of the project in your production applications.

## My Commitment to You

Every OSS project I manage will receive, at the very least, one commit per week, or one commit per month during particularly busy periods. This commitment aims to keep the codebase updated, secure, and equipped to resolve any issues it encounters.

If, for any reason, I am unable to honor this commitment, I will communicate this to all users well in advance of any decision to close the project.

To keep you informed about all my OSS projects, you can easily subscribe to a dedicated newsletter list at oss-list.dah-kenangnon.com. Subscribers will receive weekly updates on the subscribed projects and notifications about new projects I initiate.

## Disclaimer and Future Improvements

This policy specifically pertains to projects initiated by me as the principal maintainer and does not dictate the management of projects I haven't started. Suggestions for improvements are always welcome, and users are encouraged to create issues to share valuable insights.

As the journey unfolds, there might be future enhancements. Your input is highly valued.

Take care and stay well. Only time can guarantee health, and there may be days when my commits cease. Hoping that together, we contribute value to the world.

Best regards,
